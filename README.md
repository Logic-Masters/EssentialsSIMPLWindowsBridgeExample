## Overview

Load this program to a program slot in a processor running Essentials.  Make sure Essentials has the SIMPLBridgeExample_configurationFile.json file loaded.  For more information about SIMPL Windows bridging, refer to the Essentials Wiki [SIMPL Bridging](https://github.com/PepperDash/Essentials/wiki/SIMPL-Bridging) article.

This example program shows how a simple Crestron DM-MD8X8 chassis, with several DM-TX and DM-RMC endpoints can be bridged from Essentials to a SIMPL Windows program.  It also shows both the GLS-ODT-C-CN and GLS-OIR-C-CN occupancy sensors.

In addition you can see how you can use the bridge mechanism to access COM ports on the DM-RMC devices, as well as access any CEC port on any DM device.  There is also an example of how to utilize the TCP Client and SSH client devices from Essentials.
